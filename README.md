CS121C Data Structures Course Homework Assignments by Alexander Israelyan

## Foreword
### Prerequisites
*	Make sure you have the latest build of `g++`.
*	Also it is absolutely preferable if you have `make` in your shell.
### Structure of Files
*	At the root, folders "HW??" represent the respective homework assignments.
*	In each of them, find respective exercise by the "ex??" folder.
### Testing and Compilation
*	PLEASE use `Makefile` for compilation. There are two rules you may be interested in:
	* Running `make`, which will invoke the `all` rule, compiles the program to be turned in.
	* Running `make test`, which will invoke the `test` rule, if present, compiles a tester for the problem to help you evaluate this work.
*	There are others standard rules at your disposal, such that `clean`, `fclean`, `re` and so on that are completely interoperable (even though it is preferred if you run this on UNIX-like systems).
## Notes
### Homework 1
*	Notice that in "ex05", the starting coordinates are rather swapped. This shouldn't be an issue though.
